3.	You have finished installation, continue with the "How to use" below to start a notebook

## How to use
1. Download the notebook files
    -   Click the green button above, and click download ZIP (or [click here](https://github.com/Nickp1993/4DC10-student/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
    -   Extract the `notebooks` folder from the ZIP-file.
        - E.g. to `C:\4DC10\notebooks`
2. Every time you want to start jupyter notebook: 
    -   Open the anaconda prompt (found in windows menu)
    -   In anaconda, set the path to that of your notebooks folder by entering `cd <path>` with `<path>` the path of your notebooks folder. If you are not using your default drive (`C:\`), use `cd /D <path>`.
        - E.g. `cd C:\4DC10\notebooks`, or `cd /D F:\4DC10\notebooks`
    -   Enter `jupyter notebook`
    -	Wait till a local server has started, your browser should open it automatically, if not, [try clicking this links](http://127.0.0.1:8888/)
    -   Open one of the notebooks (files with an `.ipynb` extension)
    -	In the menubar, click kernel > change kernel >  Python (pychEnv)
3. You can now use this notebook!
    -   You can now click run to execute the cells of the notebook one-by-one (jupyter notebooks work top-down)
