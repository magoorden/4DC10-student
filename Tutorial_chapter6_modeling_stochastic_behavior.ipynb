    "Many processes in the world vary a little bit each time they are performed. Setup of machines goes a bit faster or slower, patients taking their medicine takes longer this morning, more products are delivered today, or the quality of the manufactured product degrades due to a tired operator. Modeling such variations is often done with stochastic distributions. A distribution has a mean value and a known shape of variation. By matching the means and the variation shape with data from the system being modeled, an accurate model of the system can be obtained. We use the `numpy.random` library, which has many stochastic distributions available. This chapter explains how to use them to model a system, and lists a few commonly used distributions. \n",
